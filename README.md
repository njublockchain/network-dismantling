# network-dismantling

`network-dismantling` is a framework for network dismantling, which refers to the process of strategically removing nodes from a network to disrupt its functionality. This repository provides implementations of various network dismantling algorithms, leveraging the power of PyTorch for efficient computation and flexibility.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, easily install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install network-dismantling
```

Make sure you have PyTorch and graph-tool installed if you want to run a neural-network model.

You can install PyTorch from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

You can install graph-tool from [here](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/installation.html).

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/njublockchain/network-dismantling.git
cd network-dismantling
pip install -e .
```
